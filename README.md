# Data Analysis of Healthcare Census using MySQL

In this project, we delve into the realm of healthcare data management and analysis, employing MySQL to extract valuable insights from a comprehensive healthcare census dataset. The project encompasses various stages, from database schema design to writing intricate SQL queries to address a range of problem statements.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Design an efficient and normalized database schema to accommodate healthcare census data.
- Import data from multiple sources into the respective schema tables.
- Implement data integrity constraints and establish relationships between tables.
- Develop SQL queries to address 55 distinct problem statements related to healthcare data analysis.

## Project Phases

1. **Database Schema Design**: Begin by creating a well-structured database schema that reflects the complexity of healthcare data.

2. **Data Import**: Import data from diverse sources, including patient records, medical facilities, treatments, and diagnoses.

3. **Schema Operations**: Enhance data integrity by adding primary keys, constraints, and indexes to the schema.

4. **Table Relations**: Establish relationships between tables using foreign key constraints.

5. **SQL Query Development**: Craft SQL queries to tackle 55 unique problem statements, ranging from patient demographics to treatment effectiveness.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize query execution through indexing and other performance-enhancing techniques.

7. **Results Presentation**: Present insights gained from SQL queries using tables, charts, and graphs.

8. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation covering schema design, data import, query formulations, and results interpretation.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain expertise in database schema design and normalization techniques.
- Acquire hands-on experience in importing and managing data within a MySQL database.
- Develop proficiency in crafting complex SQL queries for diverse data analysis tasks.
